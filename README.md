me# Shiny-AirBnBChicago
This is an implementation of a R Shiny dashboard that supports exploratory data analysis of the AirBnB data from Chicago. In addition to the story telling process, the dashboard also makes use of *Leaflet* to find AirBnB rentals near the location of the user.


Data Source: Data was downloaded from http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html. The website contained data scraped from the AirBnB site in May 2017 and has about 5000 listings. There were about 100 variables such as number of bathrooms/bedrooms/guests, neighborhoods, cancellation policy, reviews, list of amenities, etc.
